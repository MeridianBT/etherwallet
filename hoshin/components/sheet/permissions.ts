/**
 * The client-side mirror of `lib/auth/permissions.ts`'s structure-edit rule.
 *
 * This decides which pencils and trash cans to draw - nothing else. Every
 * server action re-derives the same answer from the database and refuses
 * anything this mirror got wrong, so a stale or manipulated client can hide or
 * show a button but never actually act outside its scope.
 *
 * ADMIN  - edits anything, always.
 * OWNER  - edits Level 4 rows within their own org unit or a department
 *          beneath it. Levels 1-3 are read-only to them, because they are
 *          what every division ladders into.
 * VIEWER - edits nothing.
 *
 * "Add department" is the one exception: it hangs off a Level 2 or 3
 * Objective, which is company-wide and owned by nobody in particular, so any
 * ADMIN or OWNER may open the form there - what the form then restricts is
 * *which* org unit the new branch may be filed under.
