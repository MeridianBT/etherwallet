# UAT dataset — Drive Australia

A fictitious Australian automotive distributor, for user acceptance testing and
for demonstrating the platform to a leadership team. The company is invented;
the market conditions its measures respond to are not.

## Loading it

```bash
npm run db:seed:uat      # additive — leaves any other Ki in place
npm run db:reset:uat     # drops everything first, for a single-dataset demo
```

`db:seed:uat` is additive and idempotent, so it can be re-run. It makes 103KI
current, so the app opens on it. Note that any previously seeded demo data
stays in the database — the Divisions menu will still list the old divisions,
and the sheet's DIC picker will still offer them. For a clean demo with nothing
but this dataset, use `db:reset:uat`, which drops the database first.

## What it contains

| | |
|---|---|
| **103KI** | Apr 2026 – Mar 2027, current. 54 Control Items, 1,512 figures |
| **104KI** | Apr 2027 – Mar 2028, created empty so the multi-year workflow can be shown |
| Structure | 5 Goals, 13 Level 2 Themes, 15 Level 2 Objectives, 2 Level 3 Themes, 3 Level 3 Objectives, 8 Level 4 department branches |
| Data | PRB targets for all twelve months, OB targets a little under them, actuals keyed April–July |
| People | 14 accounts, password `hoshin` — see below |

The five Level 1 Goals are Profit and Growth, Brand, Customer, Network and
People.

## The market it is set in

Targets are set against the Australian new-vehicle market as it stood in
mid-2026, so the numbers survive contact with people who know the industry:

- **A record market.** July 2026 delivered 108,577 vehicles, past the previous
  July record; the June quarter set an all-time high of 330,111.
- **Electrification at a tipping point.** BEVs took 21.7% of July 2026 and
  17.3% year to date. BEV, PHEV and hybrid together were 49% of the June
  quarter.
- **NVES is live and now public.** CO2 limits of 117 g/km for passenger
  vehicles in 2026 and 180 g/km for light commercials, at a $50 liability per
  gram over, with manufacturers missing the target named publicly from
  February 2026 and penalties issued from 2028.
- **Chinese brands are taking share.** 24% across the first two months of 2026,
  up from 14% a year earlier; 35.5% of June 2026 sales were China-built.
- **Front-end margin is thin.** Australian dealers run around 3.5% net profit,
  back to thirty-year averages — which is why aftersales carries this plan.

## The story the data tells

Deliberately mixed. A demo where everything is green teaches a leadership team
nothing, and one where everything is red is not credible.

- **Under pressure**: market share drifting below plan, NVES CO2 above the
  117 g/km limit and a liability accruing against it, dealers still trading at
  a loss, technician vacancies.
- **Recovering**: contact centre answer rates, EV consideration, high-voltage
  certification and lapsed-customer recovery all climbing month on month.
- **Ahead**: digital cost per lead, configurator completion.

## Accounts

Password for all of them is `hoshin`.

| Email | Role | Sees |
|---|---|---|
| `md@driveaus.example` | ADMIN | Everything, plus the year selector and Admin |
| `sales.director@driveaus.example` | OWNER · SLS | Sales & Network and its departments |
| `aftersales.director@driveaus.example` | OWNER · AFT | Aftersales, parts and service |
| `service.manager@driveaus.example` | OWNER · AFT-SVC | One department only — the narrowest view |
| `board@driveaus.example` | VIEWER | Read-only, no entry screen |

Signing in as the aftersales director and then the service manager is the
quickest way to show scoping without explaining it.

## Reading the sheet mid-year

Two things look alarming at first glance and are not:

- **Quarter columns for a part-finished quarter.** Q2 holds July only, so a
  summed measure reads about a third of its quarterly target. The month
  columns beside it are the honest view.
- **Ki totals for summed measures.** Four months of actual against twelve
  months of target lands near 33%. That is year-to-date against a full year,
  which is how a Hoshin sheet is normally read — but it is worth saying out
  loud before someone in the room says it for you.
