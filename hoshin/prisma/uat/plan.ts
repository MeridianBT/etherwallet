/**
 * A fictitious Australian automotive distributor's Hoshin plan, for UAT and
 * for demonstrating the platform to a leadership team.
 *
 * The company is invented. The market conditions the measures respond to are
 * not — the targets are set against the Australian new-vehicle market as it
 * actually stood in mid-2026, so a room full of automotive people recognise
 * the numbers rather than argue with them:
 *
 *   - A record market. July 2026 delivered 108,577 vehicles, past the previous
 *     July record; the June quarter set an all-time high of 330,111.
 *   - Electrification at a tipping point. BEVs took 21.7% of July 2026 and
 *     17.3% year to date; BEV, PHEV and hybrid together were 49% of the June
 *     quarter.
 *   - NVES is live and now public. From 1 July 2025 the standard sets CO2
 *     limits — 117 g/km for passenger vehicles in 2026, 180 g/km for light
 *     commercials — with a $50 liability per gram over, and manufacturers
 *     missing the target named publicly from February 2026.
 *   - Chinese brands are taking the market. 24% share across the first two
 *     months of 2026, up from 14% a year earlier; 35.5% of vehicles sold in
 *     June 2026 were China-built.
 *   - Front-end margin is thin. Australian dealers now run around 3.5% net
 *     profit, back to thirty-year averages, which is why aftersales — service
 *     retention, workshop efficiency, parts margin — carries the plan.
 *
 * Every Level 1 Goal is one of the five the business runs on: Profit and
 * Growth, Brand, Customer, Network, People.
